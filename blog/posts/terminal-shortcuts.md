# Basic terminal shortcuts

Based on an interactive miniseries at work. Meant for zsh, but mostly works for bash too.

The format isn't fully defined, but I try to include one major change/plugin and four tiny things per week.

## Week 1: Avoid repetition

Week 1 is all about not typing out the same command multiple times.

### `!$`

`!$` refers to the **last** token from the previous command. Here's how to _not_ use it:

```zsh
grep "a needle" ./some-file.txt
vim ./some-file.txt
```

Here's a better way:

```zsh
grep "a needle" ./some-file.txt
vim !$
```

`!$` gets expanded to the last token in the previous command, rendering the exact same command with less typing.

### `!:2`

Closesly related to `!$`, `!:2` refers to the token at index 2 (i.e., the third token because zero-indexing) in the previous command.

Reusing the example, `grep "a needle" ./some-file.txt` contains the following three tokens (from zsh's perspective):

0. `grep`
1. `"a needle"`
1. `./some-file.txt`

Here, `!:2` refers to the token at index 2: `./some-file.txt`. Therefore, we can achieve our goal as such:

```zsh
grep "a needle" ./some-file.txt
vim !:2
```

Obviously, index-based substitution is more flexible than `!$`. If you find that your `grep` command takes too long and would like to run the same command with something faster like [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) instead, you can do:

```zsh
grep "a needle" ./some-file.txt
rg !:1 !:2
```

Or, combine with `!$` to make it even shorter:

```zsh
grep "a needle" ./some-file.txt
rg !:1 !$
```

### `!!`

Also closely related to `!$` and `!:2`, `!!` is substituted with the entire previous command.

You may be looking for all occurrences of "a needle" in all files in a directory:

```zsh
grep -R "a needle"
```

You may then want to only list matching file names (using `grep`'s `-l` switch).

Here's how to not do it:

```zsh
grep -R "a needle"
grep -R "a needle" -l
```

Here's how to use `!!`:

```zsh
grep -R "a needle"
!! -l
```

### `zsh-autosuggestions`

Admittedly, [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) is a plugin, not a shortcut.

Inspired by the autosuggestion system in [fish](http://fishshell.com/), it uses your command history to offer autocompletion of the command you're currently typing.

The functionality overlaps greatly with the reverse-i-search (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>), but I frequently forget that I can search my history; the autosuggestions function as a reminder to avoid repetition.

![zsh-autosuggestions completes my vim command, adjusting as I type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theneva/lehmann-tech/master/packages/server/zsh-autocomplete.gif)

Here, zsh-autosuggestions first attempts to complete my command to the last command I ran. As I type something that doesn't match its prediction, it adjusts the prediction. Hitting <kbd>â†’</kbd> completes the command.
